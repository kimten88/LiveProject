<h2>LiveProjectC#</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
  I had the absolute pleasure of participating in a C# live project at my Coding Bootcamp, The Tech Academy. I collaborated in Agile Scrum environment with
  my peers to excercise our Full Stack Developer skills. This project lasted two weeks, and gave me first hand experience in working as a software developer. 
  This project was an MVC Web Application in C# for a local theatre company. This project was not a simulation, it had clear instructions from the client. 
  I had to create CRUD pages which fit the client's needs, obey their design, fix bugs, and create a user friendly experience. 
  
  I was able to experience how important it was to ensure error free code. The MVC format gave me an oppurtinity to use all of my Full Stack skills. There were some UI user stories which focused on styling, but most of the content focused on utilizing back end and database knowledge.

<h4>Photo Storage & Retrieval for Rental Items</h4>
<p>
The client wants the ability to add images to the model. We allow users to upload files from their file system. I converted the uploaded images into a byte array and store it into the database. The byte representing the photos are able to be retrieved from the database and converted it back into an image which is displayed on View.

<h4>Display Database Items in a Table</h4>

<p>
  Using Bootstrap cards I created cards for each item in the database. The cards each had their own overlay with edit and delete links appearing only when hovering over the image. Each card is clickable, sending the user to the item details page.

<h4>Create & Edit Pages Styling</h4>
<p>
  I styled the Create and Edit pages to reflect the client's expectations within the user story. This styling includes the Submit and Back to List buttons, header above the form, placeholders in all input fields, have the form in a centered container, and have all elements match the color scheme specified by the client.
