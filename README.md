<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
  I had the absolute pleasure of participating in a C# live project at my Coding Bootcamp, The Tech Academy. I collaborated in Agile Scrum environment with
  my peers to excercise our Full Stack Developer skills. This project lasted two weeks, and gave me first hand experience in working as a software developer. 
  This project was an MVC Web Application in C# for a local theatre company. This project was not a simulation, it had clear instructions from the client. 
  I had to create CRUD pages which fit the client's needs, obey their design, fix bugs, and create a user friendly experience. 
  
  I was able to experience how important it was to ensure error free code. The MVC format gave me an oppurtinity to use all of my Full Stack skills. There were some UI user stories which focused on styling, but most of the content focused on utilizing back end and database knowledge.
